    <p><i><b>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A Country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture</p>

            <p class="left"> Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman Goddess of Dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
                The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmospherein the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

            <p class="right">When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake---namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practice year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>
